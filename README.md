# RojakJelah
A Bahasa Rojak translator, developed for a diploma final year team project 


## Rules for working on the project
1. Create a new branch out from `main` for every new feature or changes that you want to add to the project. If a feature is based on another WIP feature, create the branch under the WIP branch. **Never ever** modify the main branch directly and merge prematurely. 
Branches should be named using the following format:
`[uniqueNo]_[brief_task_description]`
> E.g: 
- 1_add_button_functionality ✔
- 2_change_theme_font_type ✔
- 1_fix_previous_mistake ✘ **(Not unique id and uninformative description)**

2. When a feature/change is completed, create a pull request (PR) for the feature to be merged into the main branch. Branches can only be merged if the PR is approved by majority of the team and if there are no other subtasks assigned for the issue.

3. Periodically review and resolve the statuses of pull requests made by other members that have been completed during your free time to hasten development.
